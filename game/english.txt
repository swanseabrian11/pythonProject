An equally special thanks to everyone else who has contributed in other ways. and deshipu for moderating the discord chat to keep it friendly. Thanks to the twitter folk. Thanks to everyone who puts their game up on the pygame website for others to look at. Thanks to people making tutorials and sharing. Thanks to the r/pygame mods and community. Thanks to pyladies groups for running fun sessions. We want to make distributing pygame apps easier for people. and source for people to download with a pay-what-you-feel option.
Next step is to release the game on Steam. For the next step we need to raise 100 for the Steam App fee. We also have to make the game better. but requires more mini games and more polish. We also need to make pygame 2 pre-release binaries so that we can actually publish on Steam.
